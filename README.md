# Graphs in ML 
The graphs come handy whenever we deal with relations between the objects.  This course, focused on learning, will present methods involving two main sources of graphs in ML: 1) graphs coming from networks, e.g., social, biological, technology, etc. and 2) graphs coming from flat (often vision) data, where a graph serves as a useful nonparametric basis and is an effective data representation for tasks as spectral clustering, manifold or semi-supervised learning. We discuss online decision-making on graphs, suitable for recommender systems or online advertising.  Finally, we  discuss the scalability of all approaches and learn how to address huge graphs in practice. The lectures show not only how but mostly why things work.
